Metrics:
I would check the cpu / ram usage first, because those will crash the system
if they deplete.
Then I would monitor the bond usage, and check more specific metric in the
load-balancer api like frontend time to respond, concurrent session, queues,
and compare them with backend over time.

How ?
Probably setup a ELK stack, but it can also be done on more classical (naggios),
that way the state and values can accessed.

Challenges
The problem is to identify what is threshold in the metrics should trigger
an investigation, check if it is a ddos or huge traffic spike.

In the case of traffic spike, it could trigger a ci task, that boot a machine or
vm, to help with the amount of connections.

So the main challenge of this kind of monitoring, is to find a proper response,
that will help the system without increasing technical debt.
